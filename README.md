# CV

  I am currently learning web development through 'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu'. While I have experience maintaining Java, C++, and Python, I do not have ANY experience in a web development type role. 
  
  I want to pivot my career toward a Full Stack position to broaden my experience and to attain a job overseas. I believe a change will increase my confidence and provide a better outlet for my curiosity. I plan to also go through 'The Odin Project' to apply the knowledge learned from the Udemy course.
